        <p> September 22, 2021: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFEE3w7F0ww">Lex Fridman interview with Travis Oliphant</a> </p>
        <p> (Okay, this isn't a read, but nonetheless it's a really great interview. Travis Oliphant is the creator of Numpy and Scipy among other things, and talks a lot about the historical development of these now-integral tools.)

            <p> In what way names were applied to things. Filtration. Not every word that has been applied, still exists. Through proliferation and differentiation. Airborn. Here, this speck and this speck you missed. </p>
            <p> Numbers in cell division. Spheres of doubt. The paradigm's stitchery of unrelated points. What escapes like so much cotton batting. The building, rather, in flames. Does flight happen in an order. </p>

          <p> Define lonliness? <br>
             Yes. <br>
             It's what we can't do for each other. <br>
             What do we mean to each other? <br>
             What does a life mean? <br>
             Why are we here if not for each other? </p>

          <p>Gately remembered some evil ****ing personal detoxes[...]Abrupt Withdrawl. The Bird. Being incapable of doing it and yet having to do it, locked in. A Revere Holding cage for 92 days. Feeling the edge of every second that went by. Taking it a second at a time. Drawing the time in around him real tight. Withdrawing. Any one second: he remembered: the thought of feeling like he'd be feeling this second for 60 more of these seconds -- he couldn't tell. He could not ****ing deal. He had to buld a wall around each second just to take it. The whole first two weeks of it are telescoped in his memory down into like one second -- less: the space between two heartbeats. A breath and a second, the pause and gather between each cramp. An endless Now stretching its gull-wings out on either side of his heartbeat. And he'd never before or since felt so excruciatingly alive. Living in the Present between pulses. What the White Flaggers talk about: living completely In The Moment. A whole day at a crack seemed like tit, when he Came In. For he had Abided With The Bird.</p>

            "They seek superficial beauties, immediately available and enjoyed; above all, they want the unexpected and the novel. Accustomed to the struggles and monotony of practical life, they crave lively and rapid emotions, sudden revelations, brilliantly depicted stories of truth or wrongdoing which offer immediate escapism and plunge them direcly and almost violently straight into the subject."

          <p>Through the staked fence, moving about, I see<br>
          a scattering: of soldiers, trees, and roads;<br>
          and an old woman standing by her gate<br>
          who shews on a black hunk of bread with salt.<br>
          <br>
          What have these grey huts done to anger you,<br>
          my God? and why must so many be killed?<br>
          A train passed, wailing, and the soldier wailed<br>
          as its retreating path got trailed with dust.</p>

            "Either the hidden properties which governed the behavior of subatomic particles were nonlocal-- meaning they could instantaneously influence one another at an arbitrary distance-- or else the very notion of particles having intrinsic properties in the absence of observation had to be abandoned. The latter opened up a deep ontological void-- unless one adopted a radical positivism and contented oneself with developing a mathematical formalism which predicted the observable and gave up on any idea of an underlying reality. Naturally, it was this last option which won over the majority of researchers."

            How will this "virtual terraform" affect the consumer? One area of application, Ostman suggests, lies in virtual interactive environments populated by synthetic sentiences and evolvable avatars that can change to become increasingly independent from the humans they represent. Ostman predicts the emergence of virtual shopping malls that have dynamic environments adapted to the needs, preferences, and desires of an individual consumer. Instead of the static spaces of present-day malls, these virtual malls would "read" a consumer's avatar for initial information about the consumer. Then,[...]adjust the environment and behaviour of behavior of synthetically sentient characters so they coadapt with the consumers desires. If your responses indicate that you like purple, the enviroment will increasingly display this color. The effect, Ostman predicts, will be so compelling it will make the experience more like entertainment than shopping. [...] What does the human participant receive that makes this co-optation into a capitalistic marketing process worthwhile for her? Not just any entertainment, but Entertainment so intense and personally tailored to her individual responses and psychology that it is irresistible.
