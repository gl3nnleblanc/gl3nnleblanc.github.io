<h2 id="projects"> Projects </h2>

  <h3>QuSP</h3>
  <p>
  A playground for simulating 1D quantum systems with matrix product states
  (also known as tensor trains). There is a fairly comprehensive <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gl3nnleblanc/pdrp2021/master/report/MPS.pdf">writeup</a>
  available at the <a href="https://github.com/gl3nnleblanc/pdrp2021">repository</a>
  containing further details.
  </p>


  <h3>Quantum Partial Search</h3>
  
  <p>
  An
  <a href="https://github.com/gl3nnleblanc/partial-quantum-search">implementation</a>
  of a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0407122">partial Grover search algorithm</a>
  using Rigetti's forest API.

  <h3>Gitlet</h3>
  <p>
  A version-control system designed and written from scratch in Java using
  object-oriented design that mimics some of the basic features of
  <a href="https://git-scm.com">Git</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
  This project was the capstone project for
  <a href="https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61b/fa19/">CS 61B</a>, the data
  structures course at UC Berkeley.

<h2 id="blog"> Quotes I Like </h2>
  <ul class="center">
      <li>
          <p> In what way names were applied to things. Filtration. Not every word that has been applied, still exists. Through proliferation and differentiation. Airborn. Here, this speck and this speck you missed. </p>
          <p> Numbers in cell division. Spheres of doubt. The paradigm's stitchery of unrelated points. What escapes like so much cotton batting. The building, rather, in flames. Does flight happen in an order.</p>
          <p>-Myung Mi Kim</p>
      <li>
          <p> Mystery is blind, but wills you </p>
          <p> To untie the cloth, in eternity. </p>
          <p>-Joy Harjo</p>
      <li>
          <p> Define lonliness? </p>
          <p> Yes. </p>
          <p> It's what we can't do for each other. </p>
          <p> What do we mean to each other? </p>
          <p> What does a life mean? </p>
          <p> Why are we here if not for each other? </p>
          <p>-Claudia Rankine</p>
      <li>
          <p>
          "Peasant so that she whom the wind wounds can emerge from the mountain's head"
          </p><p>-Aimé Césaire</p>
      <li>
          <p>
          "Written texts make available the notion that one knows what one has merely read"
          </p><p>-Anne Carson</p>
      <li>
          <p>
          "Now that the human mind has grasped celestial and terrestrial physics, both vegetable and animal, there remains one science, to fill up the series of sciences or observations--social physics. This is what men have now most need of..."
          </p><p>-Auguste Comte</p>
      <li>
          <p>
          "The moment you can wholly define why you love someone it is no longer true love. The French use <em>je ne sais quoi</em> to express this invisible force."
          </p><p>-Slavoj Žižek</p>
      <li>
          <p>
          "They seek superficial beauties, immediately available and enjoyed; above all, they want the unexpected and the novel. Accustomed to the struggles and monotony of practical life, they crave lively and rapid emotions, sudden revelations, brilliantly depicted stories of truth or wrongdoing which offer immediate escapism and plunge them direcly and almost violently straight into the subject."
          </p><p>-Alexis de Tocqueville</p>
      <li>
          <p>
          "To do something truly original, and to do it well-- that is what being human is really all about, and it alone justifies the self-love that is pride."
          </p><p>-Richard Taylor</p>
      <li>
          <p>
          "Either the hidden properties which governed the behavior of subatomic particles were nonlocal-- meaning they could instantaneously influence one another at an arbitrary distance-- or else the very notion of particles having intrinsic properties in the absence of observation had to be abandoned. The latter opened up a deep ontological void-- unless one adopted a radical positivism and contented oneself with developing a mathematical formalism which predicted the observable and gave up on any idea of an underlying reality. Naturally, it was this last option which won over the majority of researchers."
          </p><p>-Michel Houellebecq</p>
